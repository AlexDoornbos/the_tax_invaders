    <h1> Celeste </h1>
    <p> Created by Maddy Thorson, and released in 2018, celeste is a singleplayer 2d platformer, and it embodies
        everything people love about the 2d
        platformer genre. It has beautiful artwork, bangin music and enticing gameplay, keeping the snes era graphics
        and feel and adding more modern
        artwork and game mechanics </p>
    <h2> Soundtrack by Lena Raine </h2>
    <p> The soundtrack for this game is widely regarded as one of the best soundtracks for an indie platformer. It's
        written by lena raine, who is also
        famous for writing music for the later updates of minecraft. The music adds suspense and atmosphere to the
        levels, and adds perfectly to the aesthetic
        feel of the game. </p>
    <h2> Smooth Satisfying Gameplay</h2>
    <p> Gameplay is the most important part of any game, and celeste hasn't slacked off in the least. It's taken the
        classic 2d platformer elements like the
        double jump and the wall slide, and taken them up to eleven. The way the movement mechanics combine with the
        level design is incredibly satisfying, and
        makes you feel powerful without the game getting too easy. The game also includes plenty of puzzle elements
        which combine with the regular gameplay to
        create fun levels that require you to combine your puzzle solving skills with your fast reaction times. All of
        this comes together into the best 2d
        platformer that I personally have ever played. </p>
    <h2> The Allegory </h2>
    <p> Every story has a moral, and celeste is no different. On the surface, it seems pretty simple. Never give up,
        yada yada, we've all seen it before. But dig
        a little deeper and it becomes something more meaningful. The creator of celeste, Maddy Thorson has come out as
        transgender since the release of the game
        in 2018, and according ot her, the game in its entireity is an allegory for the trans experience and the
        challenges that come with it. In the game,
        madeline suffers from mental health issues like anxiety and depression, and as she climbs the mountain, she
        overcomes those issues. This reflects the
        real life mental health issues that come with being transgender, and the proverbial mountain that you must climb
        in order to overcome them. Not only is
        this confirmed by the creator of the game, but the artist for the game's music is also trans. Coincidence? I
        think not ! </p>
    <h2> The Art </h2>
    <p> Celeste's art, drawn by Amora Bettany is one of the game's most alluring elements. In the game, you climb
        through an abandoned city, snowcapped peaks,
        crystal caverns, a cherry blossom forest and more. When I was looking at the steam page, the art was what fully
        persuaded me to buy it, and I'm sure
        other people feel the same. Amora somehow takes the snes era graphics and make then look like they were rendered
        with a top of the line graphics card
        without ever taking away from the pixel style. It's incredible how much detail and beauty the artist was able to
        cram into so few pixels. </p>
