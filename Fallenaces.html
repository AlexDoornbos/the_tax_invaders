        <!--new section and its the soundtrack-->
    <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
    <p class="musictext">Fallen Aces soundtrack was created by David Baron and inspired by the James Bonds films. Each
        song has been cafted to create a sense or tone in which ever levels its used in. Such as Levels 2's track has
        many boat noises as it is on a dock yard. However the track I've choosen is from the start of the game, in which
        your in Mikes apartment and is soothing chill track.</p>

    <!--History starts here-->
    <h2>History of the game</h2>
    <p>Fallen Aces is a game that has been in development hell for years. Created by Trey Powell, Fallen Aces has been
        in development for years. First being called Fallen Angles, Fallen Aces had a released public demo in 2021,
        which was a 10-15 min one level demo, but showed great progress. By December 2021, a Christmas update added the
        Tommy Gun and more enemies as well as Christmas themed objects and snow during the month of December. However,
        no updates to game were made over 3 years. The only updates mainly being clips of updated content by Trey on
        twitter, showing sprites, music demos, and comic strips were shown but no further updates were made to the game
        until 2024, in which Early access was released showing of "Episode 1".</p>
    <p>Months later the "Turf War" update was released updating and adding more detail to episode one and completely
        over hauling level three with more detail and a gun shop.</p>

        podcast episode on the creator and creation on Fallen Aces!</a>
    <h2>What's its legacy?</h2>
    <p>Fallen Aces legacy shows true potential for a new open sim game with a very distinct art style (It takes weeks
        just to make the animations for a single character!) with its comic book art style and its detailed levels, I'm
        excited to see what New Blood has next. I heard next, that their maybe plans of the Level creator being added in
        next update but there is no release date.</p>
